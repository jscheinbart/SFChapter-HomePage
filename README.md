Using HTML, and CSS, this project was an exercize in branding, accessibility, and responsive design. Elements on the homepage respond to the browser size being changed. 

## Technologies and Techniques

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Flex-Box

## Code Examples
A snippit of the HTML below shows how social media icons were included and to be active, clickable elements that open a new window in the browser. 

```HTML

    <img src="resources/twitter-logo.png" class="social-media-icon">
  </a>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13943806/" target="blank">

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the overcast afternoons in the Outer Richmond of San Francisco. Having explored much of fog city thoughout the COVID-19 Pandemic via bicycle, I wanted to include the juxtaposition of the warmth of the golden-gate bridge and the coolness of the fog in the design of the page.

Part of the Full-Stack Developer course at Codecademy.
